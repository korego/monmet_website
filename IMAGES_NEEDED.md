## 💡 ALTERNATIVE: Use Placeholder Images

If you want to launch quickly, you can:

1. Use a solid color hero background with gradient
2. Use text-based manufacturer logos temporarily
3. Add custom images later when available

Current design is functional without these images but will look much more professional with them.
